# Python examples for Platform.sh

This project is a showcase for working with services supported by Platform.sh. Each example connects to a different service using the Platform.sh Python configuration library, `platformshconfig`. It is compatible with Python version 3.5 and later.

You can install the configuration library using:

```bash
pip install platformshconfig
```

Each example provides a starter kit for connecting to these services and working with the configuration library, which can be expanded to larger projects. You can find additional information about using [Python on Platform.sh](https://docs.platform.sh/languages/python.html) and the individual [Services](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/services.html) in our [Public Documentation](https://docs.platform.sh/).
